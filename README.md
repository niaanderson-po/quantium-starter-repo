Developed an interactive Dash application that enabled the client to assess the impact of price changes on sales and profitability.

Implemented a test suite to verify the Dash application is working and a bash script to automatically run the test suite.

Developed an intuitive user interface to make the application enjoyable and engaging for the client to interact with.
